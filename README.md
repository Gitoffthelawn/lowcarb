# lowcarb

A Firefox Plugin to remove unwanted cookies but keeps your whitelisted cookies. 

[Get it from mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lowcarb/)

Use lowcarb if you care about privacy but also want to be logged in specific sites or keep your site settings.

Go to the add-on options page, select which cookies you want to keep. Remove them on demand, let lowcarb remove unwanted cookies on start-up. Come back later if you want to keep other cookies.

It's designed to be easy to use and to be touch friendly on mobile platforms.
Based on new  [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) API, lowcarb will be keep working after mozilla removes support for old add-on mechanism in near futures Firefox releases.

#### Limitations
The WebExtension API is quite new and not fully supported on all Firefox platforms. This causes the options page **not to be displayed on Firefox Mobile** currently :(

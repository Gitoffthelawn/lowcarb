[Get it from mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lowcarb/)

Use lowcarb if you care about privacy but also want to be logged in specific sites or keep your site settings.

Go to the add-on options page, select which cookies you want to keep. Remove others on demand, let lowcarb remove unwanted cookies on start-up. Come back later if you want to keep other cookies.

It's designed to be easy to use and to be touch friendly on mobile platforms.
Based on new [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) API, lowcarb will keep working after mozilla removes support for old add-on mechanisms in near future.
